I created a basic platformer wiuth jumps reseting when touching platforms or other players, the design behind this was to improve speed, there are checkpoints every now and then, there is a time sytem to judge yourself with and every time you fall into the abyss you gain 10 seconds, there used to be a damage/health system butr in the end I decided the game was better off without nit.

There is a chat system howver it broke towards the end and I couldn't fix it, furthermore the plugin I was using to test host/client started becoming less reliable over time which made fixing it wihin time impossible. There is also a scoreboard that i do not bnelive works, no idea why honeslty.

I gave a link to google driver as git-hub refused to loet me upl√∂oad files bigger then 25GB:s and I could only get the files so small.

Getting things to replicate when I wanted them to and not replicate when I didn't whant them to.

As I am writing this I relized that the sytem to keep UI and camera seperate is most likely the thing that made the chat break but I no longer have time to fix that.


OBS!! Tried downloading the zip file for editor on my shool computer and it can't be unpacked, the github now does however have a file with the scripts.
